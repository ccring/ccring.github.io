  <h1>Ruby-doc and ...JavaScript-doc?</h1>
  <h2>Ruby and JS Documentation</h2>

    One of the main differences between Ruby and JS that I have noticed is in the documentation for each language.
    In regards to Ruby, I have been using the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/">Ruby-doc</a> almost exclusively.
    It is incredibly comprehensive and well laid out. Here you can find information on every individual method and class,
    and this becomes especially helpful when you're trying to find a method to perform some specific function in relation
    to a certain object; it can get very specific so that your method calls become very concise and particular, creating
    quite elegant bits of code. The Ruby-doc has helped me out especially when trying to iterate over different data
    structures. Despite this, I think that the it can be a bit daunting when you are just starting to learn the language.
    The entries themselves can be quite esoteric and difficult to understand, and the examples provided are a bit narrow
    and don't really cover the entire scope of what the method can do unless you do a bit of experimentation.

    When it comes to JavaScript, the documentation is a bit different. I have mostly been using
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">MDN</a> and
    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp">W3 Schools</a> in my brief experience with JS. The great part about
    these documents is that they are very easy to navigate, in my opinion much easier to navigate than the Ruby-doc. In
    addition, I found that I was able to fully comprehend the content of these websites much faster than I was able to do
    so with the Ruby-doc. I believe this is not only becuase I now have a bit of experience reading such documentation, but
    also becuase the way the entries on the JS documentation are written are a little bit more intuitive than they are on the 
    Ruby-doc. The only shortfall I can see in these documents compared to the Ruby-doc as of right now is that they don't seem
    as comprehensive, but this is quite probably becuase I have not spent nearly as much time with them as I have with the 
    Ruby-doc.
