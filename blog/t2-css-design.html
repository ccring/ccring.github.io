  <h2>Positioning in CSS</h2>
  <h4>May 12, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>There are four main positions you need to know about in CSS</p>
    <h3>Static</h3>
    <p>Static positioning is the default for every HTML element in CSS. The elementes adhere only to the flow of the page, and you can't change their position using the "top, right, bottom, left" values.     
    </p>
    <h3>Fixed</h3>
    <p>Fixed elements are removed from the normal flow of the page. This allows them to overlap other elements and stay in the same position relative to the browser window no matter what.        
    </p>
    <p>Think of it like when you're reading an article on the internet and an advertisement pops up on the page. Sometimes it just stays there even if you're scrolling down and trying to move it out of the way. You can also think of a less annoying example as a sidebar that stays the same despite scrolling or resizing the browser.        
    </p>
    <h3>Relative</h3>
    <p>This position is called relative because it moves the element based on its static/default position. When you add parameters like "top, right, bottom, left" you can think of it as the elements moving whatever measurement and dirrection you specified away from the default position.</p>
    <h3>Absolute</h3>
    <p>This means that the element is placed relative to its parent element. Often elements are given absolute positioning in order to be moved precisely inside a relatively positioned element.</p>
    <p>It's good to note that if there is no parent element, the abolute positioned element is positioned as if the html itself, or the entire broswer window, is the parent element.</p>
    <p>I hope this was informative and made sense, and happy coding!</p>
