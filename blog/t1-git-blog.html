      version control allows you to keep track of every single change that you make to your code. You can save your code at any point and work forward, but it you wish to return to a previous version to see what you had done before, or to start again from that point, you can bring up that "save point" and continue working from there.

        GitHub gives you an online are to store all of your versions and changes in your code. You not only can you see who made what changes to what specifinc piece of code and when, but you can also fork and clone pieces of code so that you can work on them yourself and subsequently add it to GitHub for others to work on.

        GitHub is a great place to store code becuase it allows for collaboration. You can make your repository private so that only a select few people can work on your project, or you can make it puclic so that anyone can contribute, change, or share code. Also, it allows for people to clone repositories and work on them remotely.
