  <h1>Feedback</h1>
  <h2>My Crash-Course in Pair Programming</h2>
  <h4>Date</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Over the past few weeks it has become glaringly evident that pairing is an incredibly important part of the DBC curriculum, and I have learned to love it! I have paired with numerous people up to this point, and every single one has been a good experience. I don't know if I have gotten lucky or my cohort is just awesome, but I seem to have worked well with each of my pairs. Solving these challenges with others has been incredibly rewarding and I feel like I learn more in my pair challenges than my solo challenges. The ability to bounce ideas and questions off of each other makes the challenges an even better learning experience for me, and I feel like it makes me complete all of the challenges more quickly when someone else is there to keep me on track. I have definitely had some experiences where I felt like I was in over my head, but we always can work together to solve the problems and teach each other new things.     
    </p>
    <p>Equally important to pairing is giving feedback to our pairs, and just like the pairing itself I have adopted it wholeheartedly. All the feedback I have recieved has been kind, and most of it both actionable and specific. Every criticism I have received has not felt like an attack at all, but rather a genuine suggestion to how I could improve my pairing methods, my communication skills, and my thought process. When I look back on these sessions and consider some of the criticism I have recieved, I can totally see why my methods weren't necessarily optimal and how I could improve them.
