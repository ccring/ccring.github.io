  <h1>Thinking about Thinking Style</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>May 17, 2015</h4>

    <p>I had not even considered what my thinking style is before DBC asked me to determine it with a Gregorc survey. Now, it actually makes a lot of sense. I have a concrete random thinking style, which means I like to experiment.      
    </p>
    
    <p>So far, I would say that being a concrete rando has definitely helped with my adventures in learning code. For me there has been a lot of trial and error involved in finding solutions to the problems I am presented with, and there is almost always more than one way to achieve that final product. This is perfect for experimentation! I have loved trying out different ways to complete exercises and challenges, and it especially helps that there is minimal hand-holding from DBC so we get to figure out everything on our own.       
    </p>
    <p>Even so, I have still had my fair share of struggles learning to code. I will admit that there have been a few times that I have gotten so frustrated that I wanted to pull my hair out (CSS Positioning) but remembering the things DBC has taught me has really helped me to keep my cool, take a step back, and check myself.

    <p>I have also struggled with drive to some extent. Seeing everyone else's blog posts and website designs have made me feel like a bit of a scrub. But I think I can use that to my advantage. A big part of the growth mindset is learning from every experience even if it is an obstacle or a failure, and seeing everyone else's amaxing work and successful code has inspired me to make my own better. DBC is all about learning from each other and and learning to work together to create beautiful and meaningful things. Seeing that other people are already doing just that makes me believe that I can do it as well, and that as I go on through DBC my ability will only get better and the things I create with my cohort will be beautiful.
