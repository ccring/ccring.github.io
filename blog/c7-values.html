  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h2>The Merit of a Challenge</h2>
  <h4>June 14, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
    When looking at the list of values that we were provided, the one that stood out to me the most was challenge.
    I have always been a competetive person, and my greatest opponent has always been myself; I am always competing
    with myself to get better and better at whatever it is that I am doing. Over the years, I have found that the
    best way to do this is by challenging myself. Whether it be academics, athletics, or music, I always preferred
    surrounding myself with people who were better than me. I would never get better at anything if I was never challenged,
    so what better way to do that than work with people who are smarter, faster, or more talented than me. If I am
    challenged by others I am in constant competition with myself to get better, and I'm sure the same will happen
    with coding.

    I think this value will help me especially at DBC. In my last blog I wrote about the stereotype threat that I feel
    as being a beginner in the coding world, and I think holding up my value of using challenges as a growing experience
    will help combat this very effectively. Whenever I start to feel discouraged becuase I don't know enough or get frustrated
    becuase I am not immediately understanding something, I will just remember that all of these challenges will be a
    learning experience that will allow me to grow as both a programmer and a person.
