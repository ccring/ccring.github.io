  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>Perception Becoming Reality</h2>
  <h4>June 7, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>I remember learning about sterotype threat in my into psychology class, but at that point it was just a fact that I had to engrain into my head in order to regurgitate it back onto yet another multiple choice exam. Until now, I've never really thought about my relationship with sterotype threat and how it has affected myself, my friends, and my peers.

    <p>I think the greatest way to combat stereotype threat would be to create a neutral environment where no individual's innate, unchangeable qualities are accentuated. Everyone should of course still be traeated as an individual, but every individual should be treated as if they are on a level playing field. I think DBC has already done a great job of this in emphasizing the growth vs fixed mindset and defining intelligence as a malleable entity rather than a fixed quantity. This maked me think that I have experienced stereotype threat in my DBC experience in that I have been projecting my beginner-ness onto myself. There have been a few times where I have gotten frustrated and fallen into a loop of "I'm such a noob, I can't learn this" thoughts, but DBC and especially the other people in my cohort have done a great job of being encouraging and assuring me that even a noob can do this.
