  <h1>POP!</h1>
  <h2>The Tech Bubble</h2>
  <h4>May 26, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>The issue of the tech bubble was brought into the limelight recently with Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel's grim warning that the bubble IS going to pop, and it is a mater of if not when.   
    </p>
    <p>The numbers seem to support this claim. There are over 100 tech startups valued at over one billion dollars as of now, and many of these companies have not even come close to turning a profit. VCs have been recklessly investing over the past few years in hopes of finding the next Facebook or Uber, but the chances are incredibly slim that all of these billion dollar startups will be viable enough to have good enough margins to match their valuations.        
    </p>
    <p>The real problem is who is going to be effected by this bubble if and/or when it does pop. Even though the VCs have a LOT of money invested in these companies, this is still only a fraction of some of their valuations. This means that when the bubble pops and these companies are liquidated, the VCs will most probably make all of their money back, and perhaps even turn a profit. This means that the employees of the companies are basically going to get shafted. With their theoretical worth in the toilet, equity is going to plummet and they will be left with nothing.
    </p>
    <p>How do we avoid this? Now I am no economics expert, but I am a nerd, and that gives me a perspective that some might not normally have. Let's look at two of the most popular trading card games ever: Pokemon and Magic, the Gathering. 
    </p>
    <p>Everybody and their mother collected Pokemon cards at the turn of the millennium, and everyone was hoping that they would open a new booster pack and get one of the coveted holographic cards like Charizard or Blastoise. I remember going to my local comic shop and seeing these cards in a glass case selling individually for upwards of $200. Ridiculous, I know. This trend kept going and going and created a Pokemon card bubble that inevitably popped. Now nobody gives a crap about Pokemon cards. Come on, they weren't even that great anyways.
    </p>
    <p>Now lets look at Magic, the Gathering. In my opinion, this is the most supreme of trading card games. The artwork is amazing, the gameplay is strategic and challenging, and the cards aren't that expensive. Let's focus on that last part. When Magic first started picking up steam in the mid/late 90's the same thing happened as with Pokemon; the rare cards were selling for ridiculous prices and they were facing a bubble. What was their solution? They printed a crap-load of new cards. The constant flow of new cards decreased the rarity of good cards, so the cards that used to fetch incredible prices were not so coveted anymore. They effectively deflated their bubble enough so that the Magic-microeconomy has persisted and the game remains one of the most popular tabletop games to this day. That being said, there are still some cards that can go for almost $30,000, but there not nearly as many super-rare cards as there were in Pokemon. More cards meant fewer unicorns, fewer unicorns meant deflated bubble, stable bubble over two decades means $$$$$$.

    <p>Learn your lesson from Magic, the Gathering, Silicon Valley. Less Unicorns pls.</p>
