      I thrive in a collaborative environment where I am encouraged to experiment. I love to learn from the people around me and I love to teach the people learning with me. Dev Bootcamp seems like the perfect place for me to learn a new and enjoyable skill with other people who are as entusiastic about coding as I am.

      I am really looking forward to beginning my onsite training at dev bootcamp. I know that I am going to build meaningful academic and personal relationships with the people in my cohort remotely while I am 1500 miles away from most of them. Dev bootcamp will encourage me to care about the work i am doing, but more so encourage me to care about the people I am working with, and that will make the overall experience that much more effective and rewarding.

        I am defeintely nervous about my DBC experience. I am a quintessential beginner when it comes to programming, but I know there are a few others in my cohort in the same boat as I am. I am hoping that we can learn from and build off of each other, and eventually do the same with those in our cohort with more experience so that everyone in the cohort collectively become better coders and better people.

        I am really looking forward to learning new skills that will allow me to start a career, but I am looking forward just as much to meeting people with whom I can share this experience and create a meaningful relationship.
